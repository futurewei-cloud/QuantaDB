    "Tests based on detecting cycles between operations in a history.

    First, we define a bunch of ways you can compute a dependency graph over a
    history. Our graphs use completions (e.g. ok, info) for the canonical
    representation of an operation. For instance:

    `realtime-graph` relates a->b if operation b begins after operation a
    completes successfully.

    `process-graph` relates a->b if a and b are performed by the same process,
    and that process executes a before b.

    `monotonic-key-graph` assumes op :values are maps of keys to observed values,
    like {:x 1 :y 2}. It relates a->b if b observed a higher value of some key
    than a did. For instance, {:x 1 :y 2} -> {:x 2 :y 2}, because :x is higher in
    the second op.

    You can also *combine* graphs using `combine`, which takes the union of
    multiple graphs. `(combine realtime monotonic-key)`, for instance, verifies
    that not only must the values of each key monotonically increase, but that
    those increases must be observed in real time: stale reads are not allowed.

    Given a function which takes a history and produces a dependency graph, the
    checker runs that function, identifies strongly-connected components in the
    resulting graph, and decides whether the history is valid based on whether
    the graph has any strongly connected components--e.g. cycles."

; This is going to look a bit odd. Please bear with me.
;
; Our analysis generally goes like this:
;
;   1. Take a history, and analyze it to build a dependency graph.
;   2. Find cycles in that graph
;   3. Explain why those are cycles
;
; Computing the graphs is fairly straightforward, but explaining cycles is a
; bit less so, because the explanation may require data that's expensive to
; calculate. For instance, realtime orders would like to be able to tell you
; when precisely a given ok operation was invoked, and that needs an expensive
; index to be constructed over the full history. We want to be able to *re-use*
; that expensive state.
;
; At the top level, we want to have a single object that defines how to analyze
; a history *and* how to explain why the results of that analysis form cycles.
; We also want to be able to *compose* those objects together. That means that
; both graph construction and cycle explanation must compose.
;
; To do this, we decouple analysis into three objects:
;
; - An Analyzer, which which examines a history and produces a pair of:
; - A Graph of dependencies over completion ops, and
; - An Explainer, which can explain cycles between those ops.

; We write our Analyzers as a function (f history) => [graph explainer]. Graphs
; are Bifurcan DirectedGraphs. Explainers have a protocol, because we're going
; to pack some cached state into them.

(defprotocol Anomalies
  "There are several points in an analysis where we want to construct some
  intermediate data, like a version graph, for later. However, it might be that
  *during* the construction of that version graph, we discover the graph itself
  contains anomalies. This doesn't *invalidate* the graph--perhaps we can still
  use it to discover anomalies later, but it *is* information we need to pass
  upstream to the user. The Anomalies protocol lets the version graph signal
  that additional anomalies were encountered, so whatever uses the version
  graph can merge those into its upstream anomaly set.
