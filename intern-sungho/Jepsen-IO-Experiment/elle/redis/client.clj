; There's a lot of weirdness in the way Carmine handles connection pooling;
; you're expected to pass around maps which *specify* how to build a connection
; pool, and it maps that to a connection pool under the hood--I think via
; connections/conn-pool memoization. What worries me is that that memoization
; might return connection pools for *other* clients, royally screwing up our
; open/close logic.

; Now, I can't figure out a way to just get you know, a Plain old Connection
; out of Carmine safely. So what we're gonna do here is cheat: we build a
; Carmine pool that builds a fresh conn on every call to get-conn, pull a
; connection out of it, throw away the pool (which is not in general a good
; idea, but we know what we're doing), and wrap that connection in our *own*
; pool. This doesn't have to do any actual connection tracking because we only
; ever have one thread interact with a pool at a time.
