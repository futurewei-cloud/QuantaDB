# This variable contains information about which RPCs invoke which
# other RPCs (e.g., WRITE invokes BACKUP_WRITE to replicate the new
# data). The table must be updated manually when new RPCs are
# added or existing ones are modified. Each entry in the dictionary
# describes all of the lower-level RPCs invoked (directly) by the handler
# for a particular RPC.  For example, the following entry indicates the
# the implementation of the REMOVE RPC may invoke BACKUP_WRITE and
# REMOVE_INDEX_ENTRY RPCs:
#          "REMOVE":         ["BACKUP_WRITE", "REMOVE_INDEX_ENTRY"],
# The names in the dictionary must be the same as the names used in
