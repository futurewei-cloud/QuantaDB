/**
 * RpcWrapper is the base class for a collection of classes that provide
 * a "middle management" layer just above RPC transports.  Wrappers serve
 * two overall purposes:
 * - They implement various strategies for retrying RPCs after failures.
 *   Typically a single strategy is shared among many RPCs (e.g., all RPCs
 *   attempting to communicate with the coordinator use the same strategy).
 * - They allow RPCs to be invoked asynchronously (they hold the state of
 *   the RPC, such as request and response buffers, when the invoker is off
 *   doing something else).
 * There are three layers of wrapper objects:
 * - This class is the bottommost layer, providing facilities that are
 *   common across all wrappers.
 * - This class is subclassed by the next layer, consisting of a small
 *   number of classes that implement different retry policies (see, for
 *   example, CoordinatorWrapper).
 * - The topmost layer consists of one class for each RPC, which is a
 *   subclass of the one of the middle-layer classes. These classes
 *   pack request messages and unpack response messages in an RPC-specific
 *   fashion.
 *
 * RpcWrappers are not thread-safe in general: they do correctly handle
 * synchronization with transports running in a separate dispatch thread,
 * but if a single RpcWrapper is accessed by multiple threads for any
 * other purpose, the threads must synchronize among themselves to ensure
 * that at most one thread is invoking an RpcWrapper method at a time.
