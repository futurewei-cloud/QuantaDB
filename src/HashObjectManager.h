 *
 * Each MasterService instance has a single ObjectManager that encapsulates
 * the details of object storage and consistency. MasterService knows that
 * tablets and objects exist, but is unaware of the details of their storage -
 * it merely translates RPCs to ObjectManager method calls.
 *
 * ObjectManager is thread-safe. Multiple worker threads in MasterService may
