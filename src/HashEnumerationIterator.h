/**
 * This class describes the current state of an enumeration; it is
 * created by a server, returned in serialized form to the client with
 * each batch of enumeration data, and the client then returns the
 * iterator with its next request so that the server can ensure that
 * each object is returned exactly once.
 *
 * The contents of the iterator are intentionally opaque to
 * clients. You should never need to include this header from client
 * (or client library) code.
 *
 * The iterator consists of a stack of entries, each of which describes
 * an incomplete enumeration. Together, they guarantee that each object
 * is returned exactly once, even in the face of server crashes and
 * tablet reconfigurations.
 *
 * Iterators are serialized to the network via
 * ProtoBuf::EnumerationIterator. Any changes made here must also be
 * made in ProtoBuf::EnumerationIterator.

class HashEnumerationIterator {
  public:
    /**
     * A stack frame in the iterator. Each frame is a filter that excludes
     * objects that have already been enumerated. Normally there is only
     * a single frame on the stack, which represents the current state of
     * enumerating a particular tablet. However, it is possible for an
     * enumeration to be interrupted when a tablet has been partially
     * enumerated (e.g. server crashes). When the enumeration resumes, the
     * key hash range being enumerated could be on a different server, with
     * a different tablet structure and even a different hash table structure
     * (e.g., different number of buckets in the table).  When this happens
     * an additional frame is added to the stack for the current server, but
     * the old frame is retained in order to exclude objects that were already
     * enumerated by the old server. If a tablet moves multiple times during
     * iterations then there can be multiple frames on the stack, one for each
     * reconfiguration that occurred.
     *
     * When a server receives an iterator during enumeration, it can continue
     * working with the same iterator if the \c tabletStartHash,
     * \c tabletEndHash, and \c numBuckets in the top stack entry match its own
     * configuration; if not, it must add a new frame to the top of its stack.
     * Only the top entry on the stack is updated during enumeration; the
     * others are read-only. Stack frames can be deleted once all objects with
     * key hashes less than or equal to the frame's \c tabletEndHash have been
     * enumerated.
     *
     * Any changes made here must also be made in
     * ProtoBuf::EnumerationIterator_Frame.
